          <p>
            PLEASE READ THE TERMS BELOW CAREFULLY AS THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL

          <h3>Sources of Terms and Conditions</h3>
          <p>
            Certain provisions of this Agreement may be superseded by expressly
            designated legal notices, rules or other terms located on different
            pages of the Sites. In order to participate in or use certain
            services you may be required to agree to additional or different
            terms and conditions (“Additional Terms”).
          </p>
          <p>
            Sales hosted on third party sites (“Third Party Sites”) are governed
            by and subject to the Third Party Sites&apos; Additional Terms and
            any other Additional Terms applicable to that specific sale. We have
            no control over, and do not necessarily endorse any Third Party
            Sites, services, or products. You acknowledge and agree that such
            Third Party Sites are accessed at your own risk and such risk
            includes, without limitation, any resulting tax reporting,
            compliance or payment obligations.
          </p>
          <h3>Ownership; License; Restrictions</h3>
          <p>
            Through the Sites, you may be permitted to purchase or place a bid
            on and subsequently pay for certain non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”)
            where proof of such purchase is recorded on the relevant blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Purchasing an NFT entitles you to the ownership of that certain NFT.
            Except as set forth below, you may use or resell that NFT as you
            choose, provided that any purchase of a resold NFT (the “Secondary
            Sale”) will also be subject to this Agreement and any applicable
            Additional Terms. Immediately following any Secondary Sale, your
            ownership of the NFT and rights under any associated licenses will
            terminate. Your purchase of, and the transfer of ownership of, that
            certain NFT is subject to your agreeing to this Agreement, any
            Additional Terms and any other applicable terms, including, but not
            limited to, the terms applicable to any other NFT marketplace that
            permits the Secondary Sale of NFTs in a manner that fully enables
            the smart contract contained within such NFTs (either such
            marketplace, the “Approved Marketplace”). If at any time you sell,
            trade, donate, give away, or transfer your NFT to a new owner
            through the Approved Marketplace, the associated license shall be
            transferred to that new owner, and you will have no further rights
            in or to the NFT or NFT IP (defined below). If at any time you burn
            or otherwise dispose of your NFT for any reason, or sell, trade,
            donate, give away, or transfer your NFT other than through the
            Approved Marketplace, the license will immediately expire with
            respect to that NFT without the requirement of notice or any further
            action, and you will have no further rights in or to the NFT or NFT
            IP.

            Except as expressly set forth herein, your use of the Sites does not
            grant you ownership of or any other rights with respect to any
            content, code, data, or other Site Materials that you may access on

            in this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: <br />
            (a) that your purchase of a NFT, whether via the Sites or otherwise,
            does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the Site Materials
            (including, without limitation, any copyright in and to the
            associated art) other than those expressly contained in this
            Agreement; <br />
            (b) that you do not have the right, except as otherwise set forth in
            this Agreement, to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize
            any elements of the Site Materials (including, without limitation,
            any art) without Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC&apos;s prior written
            consent in each case, which consent may be withheld in Jacqueline
            Choe Art, LLC&apos;s sole and absolute discretion; and <br />
            (c) that you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or
            attempt to use any of our trademarks or service marks, or any
            confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without Jacqueline
            Choe Art, LLC&apos;s prior written consent in each case, which
            consent may be withheld in Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC&apos;s sole and
            absolute discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with this Agreement,
            applicable Additional Terms, and any other applicable terms,
            Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC grants you, solely for your personal,
            non-commercial use, a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive,
            non-transferable (except in connection with a Secondary Sale),
            non-sublicensable, revocable license to publicly or privately
            display (including on social media platforms and digital galleries)
            any intellectual property (or related intellectual property rights
            including patent rights, patent applications and disclosures,
            copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other
            intellectual property rights recognized in any country or
            jurisdiction in the world) included in the NFT owned by you (such
            intellectual property, including any name, image, likeness, art,
            design, and drawings (in any form or media, including, without
            limitation, video or photographs) that may be included in such NFT,
            “NFT IP”) solely <br />
            (a) for your own personal, non-commercial use; <br />
            (b) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of
            your NFTs, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies
            your right to display the NFT IP to ensure that only the actual
            owner of such NFT can display such NFT IP; or <br />
            (c) as part of a third party website or application that permits the
            inclusion, involvement, or participation of your NFT, provided that
            the website/application cryptographically verifies each NFT
            owner&apos;s rights to display the NFT IP for their NFT to ensure
            that only the actual owner of such NFT can display the NFT IP, and
            provided that the NFT IP is no longer visible once the owner of the
            NFT leaves the website/application. <br />
            For clarity, except for the foregoing license, neither your purchase
            of the NFT nor this Agreement grants you any other license or rights
            to any NFT IP and you agree that all rights, titles and interests in
            and to the NFT IP belong exclusively to Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC
            (or, as applicable, its subsidiaries and/or licensors) and no rights
            are granted to you other than the foregoing license.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subject to your continued compliance with these this Agreement,
            Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC grants you a limited, worldwide,
            non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy, and display
            the NFT IP for your NFT for the purpose of commercializing your own
            merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the NFT IP for
            your NFT (“Commercial Use”), provided that such Commercial Use does
            not result in you earning more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars
            ($100,000) in gross revenue each year. For the sake of clarity,
            nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from <br />
            (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale
            of NFTs generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically
            verifies each NFT owner&apos;s rights to display the NFT IP for
            their NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the NFT
            IP; <br />
            (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that
            permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of NFTs
            generally, provided that the third party website or application
            cryptographically verifies each NFT owner&apos;s rights to display
            the NFT IP for their purchased NFT to ensure that only the actual
            owner can display the NFT IP, and provided that the NFT IP is no
            longer visible once the owner of the purchased NFT leaves the
            website/application; or <br />
            (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing, even where such
            revenue is in excess of $100,000 per year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Commercial Use license granted above applies only to the extent
            that you continue to own the applicable purchased NFT. If at any
            time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise
            dispose of your purchased NFT for any reason, the Commercial Use
            license granted above will immediately expire with respect to that
            NFT without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further
            rights in or to the NFT IP for that NFT. If you exceed the $100,000
            limitation on annual gross revenue set forth above, you will be in
            breach of this Agreement, and must send an email to Jacqueline Choe
            Art, LLC at Email: jisuchoeart@gmail.com within forty-five (45)
            days, with the phrase “Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC License - Commercial
            Use” in the subject line, requesting a discussion with Jacqueline
            Choe Art, LLC regarding entering into a broader license agreement or
            obtaining an exemption (which may be granted or withheld in
            Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC&apos;s sole and absolute discretion). If
            you exceed the scope of the Commercial Use license grant without
            entering into a broader license agreement with or obtaining an
            exemption from Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC, you acknowledge and agree
            that: <br />
            (i) you are in breach of this Agreement; <br />
            (ii) in addition to any remedies that may be available to Jacqueline
            Choe Art, LLC at law or in equity, Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC may
            immediately terminate any license that was granted to you, without
            the requirement of notice; and <br />
            (iii) you will be responsible to reimburse Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC
            for any costs and expenses incurred by Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC
            during the course of enforcing this Agreement against you.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent that NFT IP associated with your NFT contains Third
            Party NFT IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a celebrity,
            athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree as
            follows: <br />
            (i) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party NFT IP
            in any way except as incorporated in the NFT IP, and subject to the
            license and restrictions contained herein; <br />
            (ii) that the Commercial Use license above will not apply; <br />
            (iii) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the
            owner of the Third Party NFT IP, Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC may need
            to pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the
            NFT IP; and <br />
            (iv) to the extent that Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC informs you of such
            additional restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will
            be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the
            date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be
            deemed a breach of such license. The restrictions in this Section
            will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible
            under applicable law, you may not:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Profit from, license or otherwise commercialize in any way the NFT
              or its contents, including in connection with the marketing,
              advertising, or selling of any third-party product (including
              giving away such products in the hopes of eventual commercial
              gain), except as part of a Secondary Sale or as expressly
              permitted in this Agreement;
            </li>
            <li>
              Modify the NFT or its contents in any way or combine the NFT or

              digital or other content or media;
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the NFT or its contents in any manner which infringes upon the
              intellectual property rights of any person or entity;
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the NFT in connection with or to promote any illegal activity,
              hate speech, violence, inappropriate or obscene content, or in any
              other manner which could tarnish or harm the reputation of
              Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC and its employees;
            </li>
            <li>Use the NFT IP except as incorporated in your NFTs;</li>
            <li>
              Trademark, copyright, or seek to trademark, copyright, or
              otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to
              the NFT IP, including any Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC names,
              trademarks, logos, trade dress, or other source indicators
              contained or depicted therein;
            </li>
            <li>
              Attempt to mint, tokenize, or create an additional cryptographic
              token representing the NFT IP on any platform;
            </li>
            <li>
              Falsify, misrepresent, or conceal the authorship of the NFT IP or
              the NFT;
            </li>
            <li>
              Use, employ, or operate a computer program to simulate human
              behavior Bots or other similar forms of automation to engage in
              any activity or transaction on the Sites (including, without
              limitation, purchases of NFTs, creating user accounts by automated
              means or under false or fraudulent pretenses);
            </li>
            <li>
              Commit any of the foregoing actions with respect to the NFT IP;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              Encourage or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Fees; Payments; Bids</h3>
          <p>
            If you elect to purchase or trade NFTS on the Sites, or with or from
            other users via the Sites, any financial transactions that you
            engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network. We
            will have no insight into or control over these payments or
            transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any
            transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or
            to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a
            result of any transactions that you engage in via the Sites, or
            using any smart contracts, or any other transactions that you
            conduct via the Ethereum network.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transactions on the Ethereum network require the payment of a
            transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on
            the network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the
            decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay
            a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            No refunds or returns are permitted except with respect to any
            statutory warranties or guaranties that cannot be excluded or
            limited by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may,
            in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per
            person or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by
            or under the same customer account, the same payment method, and/or
            orders that use the same billing address. In the event we make a
            change to or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you by
            contacting the email and/or billing address/phone number provided at
            the time the order was made. We reserve the right to limit or
            prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed in
            bad faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to limit, change, cancel, or relist any
            auctions, without prior notice, even after bids have been submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFTs that are listed for sale through auction may be purchased using
            Ethereum.

          <h3>Assumption of Certain Risks</h3>
          <p>
            Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC is an intermediary and not an agent or
            fiduciary for any purpose. NFTs are intangible digital assets and
            exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the
            Ethereum blockchain network. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of
            the digital asset market, it is not possible to know all of the
            risks involved in making an investment in digital assets, and new
            risks may emerge at any time. The following are some, but not all,
            of the risks associated with services offered on the Sites:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Cryptocurrency and the blockchain.</strong> Jacqueline
              Choe Art, LLC does not control the public Ethereum blockchain or
              take any possession, custody or control of the Ethereum
              cryptocurrency used to purchase an NFT. By your use of the Sites,
              you acknowledge you are aware of and accept all risks associated
              with a cryptographic system, including the Ethereum blockchain,
              decentralized ledgers, smart contracts, digital wallets, and
              non-fungible tokens. Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC is not responsible
              for the operation of the Ethereum blockchain, or for any losses
              due to the Ethereum blockchain or the use of a digital currency,
              including without limitation, <br />
              (i) internet connectivity, <br />
              (ii) hardware malfunctions, <br />
              (iii) software bugs, viruses or exposure to malicious software,{" "}
              <br />
              (iv) security breaches of your digital wallet,
              <br />
              (v) system failures or outages, including our own, of a blockchain
              or blockchain application on which we depend, or with respect to
              third-party or decentralized trading platforms, applications or
              other intermediaries, counterparties or custodians, which could
              result in an indefinite loss of access to a digital asset. <br />
              There are certain risks inherent in the dependence of transactions
              involving digital assets on a “private key,” which, if lost,
              stolen or otherwise compromised, could result in the irreversible
              loss of the relevant digital assets. Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC is
              not responsible or liable for any losses resulting from, related
              to or based upon any of the foregoing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pricing digital assets.</strong> You acknowledge and
              accept the risk that the price of digital assets is highly
              speculative and volatile and may be impacted by, among other
              things, fluctuations in the price of other digital assets. Digital
              assets also suffer from valuation and liquidity challenges.
              Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC does not represent, warrant or guarantee
              the accuracy or fairness of the price of any work sold on or off
              the marketplace, or that any such works will retain or increase
              their value. You acknowledge and agree that Jacqueline Choe Art,
              LLC is not a fiduciary nor owes any duties to any user of the
              services, including the duty to ensure fair pricing of works or to
              police user behavior on the marketplace. You solely bear the risk
              of loss in purchasing, selling and/or transferring digital assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Evolving regulatory landscape.</strong> The regulatory
              landscape governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and
              NFTs is evolving. Changes in the legislative or regulatory
              environment may impact our ability to offer certain products or
              services. In addition, there are risks associated with the
              dependence on third-party decentralized trading platforms,
              applications or other intermediaries (e.g., exchanges),
              counterparties or custodians to hold or convert digital assets
              that may be subject to little or no regulation, or that may
              operate in violation of regulations, including regulations related
              to sanctions compliance and anti-money laundering.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tax Obligations.</strong> You are solely responsible for
              determining what, if any, tax obligations might arise from your
              transactions. Except as required by law, <br />
              (i) Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC is not responsible for determining
              your tax reporting or compliance obligations, and <br />
              (ii) you are solely responsible for all tax obligations, including
              payment obligations, arising from your transactions completed via
              the Sites.

          <h3>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            Mindful of the high cost of legal disputes, not only in dollars but
            also in time and energy, both you and Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC agree
            to the following dispute resolution procedure: In the event of any
            controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to
            any transaction conducted on the Sites, or the breach, enforcement,
            interpretation, or validity of this Agreement or any part of it
            (“Dispute”), the party asserting the Dispute shall first try in good
            faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the
            other party (by first class or registered mail) describing the facts
            and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the
            Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond
            to or settle the Dispute. Notice shall be sent to Jacqueline Choe
            Art, LLC at jisuchoeart@gmail.com, or:
          </p>
          <p>
            Both you and Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC agree that this dispute
            resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be
            satisfied prior to initiating any arbitration or filing any claim
            against the other party.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Arbitration Agreement.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent you cannot resolve any Dispute through the informal
            dispute resolution procedure described above, a Dispute must be
            resolved through binding individual arbitration. You and Jacqueline
            Choe Art, LLC agree to give up your right to go to court to assert
            or defend your rights under this Agreement and with respect to any
            Dispute. You and Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC expressly delegate to the
            arbitrator the authority to determine the arbitrability of any
            Dispute, including the scope, applicability, validity, and
            enforceability of this arbitration provision.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may begin an arbitration proceeding by sending an email
            requesting arbitration to: <br />
            Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC
            <br /> Email: jisuchoeart@gmail.com
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree that the arbitration shall be conducted by the American
            Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration
            Rules (“AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The
            AAA Rules are available on the AAA’s website www.adr.org, or by
            calling the AAA at (800) 778-7879. In the event the AAA is
            unavailable or unwilling to hear the Dispute, the parties shall
            agree to another arbitration provider. Payment of all filing,
            administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s
            applicable rules. Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC will reimburse those fees
            for claims totaling less than $10,000 if the arbitrator rules in
            your favor on any material aspect of your claim. Jacqueline Choe
            Art, LLC waives its right to seek attorneys’ fees and costs in
            arbitration. However, if your claim is deemed by the arbitrator to
            be frivolous or brought in bad faith or with an improper purpose, as
            measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11,
            then the arbitrator may award Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC the
            reimbursement of its costs and arbitration fees against you and/or
            your counsel. The place of arbitration will be Los Angeles,
            California. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by
            telephone, based on written submissions. You further agree that if
            your arbitration claim is filed at or around the time of other
            similar claims by the same or related counsel, you agree that your
            claim may be temporarily stayed or phased to allow the AAA to
            establish efficient and fair adjudication procedures. The language
            of the arbitration will be English. The award of the arbitrator will
            be final and binding, and any judgment on the award rendered by the
            arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC may seek and
            obtain injunctive relief in any jurisdiction in any court of
            competent jurisdiction, and you agree that this Agreement is
            specifically enforceable by Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC through
            injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of
            monetary damages.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Waiver of Right to Bring Class Actions and Representative Claims.
            </strong>
            All arbitrations must proceed on an individual basis. The arbitrator
            is empowered to resolve the Dispute with the same remedies available
            in court. However, to the extent permissible by applicable law, any
            relief must be individualized to you and shall not affect any other
            customer. You and Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC agree that each may bring
            claims against the other in arbitration only in your or Jacqueline
            Choe Art, LLC’s respective individual capacities and in so doing you
            and Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC hereby waive the right to a trial by
            jury, to assert or participate in a class action lawsuit or class
            action arbitration (either as a named-plaintiff or class member),
            and to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or
            joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind. If it is decided that
            applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s
            limitations as to a particular claim, then that claim (and only that
            claim) must proceed in court and be severed from any arbitration.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Other Terms.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement shall be
            governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance
            with, the Federal Arbitration Act. The terms of the Arbitration
            Agreement provisions shall survive after this Agreement terminates
            or your use of the Sites ends. Except as set forth above, if any
            portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid or
            unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the
            Arbitration Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remedies. Your rights and remedies in the event of any breach of
            this Agreement are strictly limited to the right, if any, to recover
            damages in an action at law, and you acknowledge that your remedy of
            money damages is adequate. You will not be entitled by reason of any
            such breach, and you will not seek any equitable relief, whether
            injunctive or otherwise.
          </p>
          <h3>Termination</h3>
          <p>
            With the exception of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall survive
            the termination of these terms, these terms are effective unless and
            until terminated by either you or Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC You may
            terminate this Agreement at any time by canceling your account on
            the App and discontinuing your access to and use of the App.
            Jacqueline Choe Art, LLC also may terminate this Agreement at any
            time without notice, and accordingly may deny you access to the
            Sites, if in our sole judgment you fail to comply with any term or
            provision of the Agreement. You agree that any suspension or
            termination of your access to the App may be without prior notice,
            and that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any
            such suspension or termination. The obligations and liabilities of
            the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the
            termination of this Agreement for all purposes. If we terminate
            these Terms or suspend or terminate your access to or use of the App
            due to your breach of these Terms or any suspected fraudulent,
            abusive, or illegal activity (including, without limitation, if you
            engage in any of the Prohibited Activities), then termination of
            these Terms will be in addition to any other remedies we may have at
            law or in equity.
          </p>
          <h3>Severability and Survival</h3>
          <p>
            If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be
            unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, <br />
            (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from
            this Agreement; <br />
            (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have
            no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement
            or the parties&apos; ability to compel arbitration of any remaining
            claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement;
            and
            <br />
            (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class,
            collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must
            be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
            arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims
            shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in
            arbitration.
          </p>
          <h3>General</h3>
          <p>

            the State of California, without regard to any conflict of law
            provisions. The waiver of any provision of the Agreement shall not
